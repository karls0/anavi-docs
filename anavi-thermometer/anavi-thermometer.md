## Assembly

You can assemble ANAVI Thermometer with your bare hands and a screw driver following the steps below:

* Add sensors to your ANAVI Thermometer.
* Optionally, you may also assemble the simple acrylic case by removing the protective film and mounting screws.
* Use 5V power supply and plug an appropriate cable in the microUSB of ANAVI Thermometer to turn on the board.

## Powering ANAVI Thermometer

ANAVI Thermometer has been tested using various 5V power supplies and USB to microUSB cables. It is recommended to use 5V power supply with 1A or higher current output. Make sure that you are using a 5V power supply from a trusted supplier. Cheap, untested power supplies can be risky and unreliable.

## Configure ANAVI Thermometer

[Video tutorial for getting started with ANAVI Light Controller, same procedure for ANAVI Thermometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_81CuuGm0Y)

Turn on ANAVI Thermometer by plugging an appropriate power supply. As soon as the board is turned on for the very first time it will create a temporary WiFi access point. Connect to it from your computer, smartphone or tablet.

The default software of ANAVI Thermometer has a captive portal which guides you through the configurations. As you see in the video you have to select your WiFi network and enter a password if it is not open.

Our open source software relies on the machine to machine communication protocol MQTT to report data from the sensors. You can connect to your own MQTT broker or just leave the default configurations and connect to the public broker as shown in the video.

It very important to copy the machine ID. Later it is needed to identify your device.

When you are ready just click save. If you have entered valid credentials in a moment ANAVI Thermometer will connect to your WiFi network and the configured MQTT broker. This way the configuration is complete and ANAVI Thermometer will turn off its temporary WiFi access point. After that your device, for example smartphone as in the video, will automatically connect again to your WiFi network.

To verify that ANAVI Thermometer is up and running open a modern web browser and visit demo.anavi.technology. Enter your machine ID. Check the advanced settings only if you are not using the default public MQTT broker. Click connect.

## Reset to Factory Defaults

If you decide to change the settings of ANAVI Thermometer you need to reset the board and configure it again.

To reset ANAVI Thermometer press the button and hold it for 10 seconds until the red light is blinking. After resetting the board there will be a steady red light that indicates that the temporary WiFi access point is on and you can proceed with the configuration again.

# CHAPTER 3: Software Development

## Default Firmware

By default ANAVI Thermometer comes with [this free and open source Arduino sketch](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-termometer-sw).

## USB to UART Module

For uploading firmware to ANAVI Thermometer you need USB to UART module. All kits include CP2102 which out of the box on GNU/Linux distributions. Drivers for MS Windows and Mac OS X are [available at silabs.com](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

## Setting up the Arduino IDE

1. Install the Arduino IDE following the instructions from from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. Add the ESP8266 board package: In **File > Preferences** input http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the Additional Board Manager URLs field.

3. In **Tools > Board ... > Boards manager** find and add the **ESP8266** package. Now "Generic ESP8266" should be an option in the **Tools > Boards** menu.

4. In **Tools > Flash Size:** select **4M (1M SPIFFS)**

5. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...** and include the following dependencies of the default firmware for ANAVI Light Controller:

* WiFiManager by tzapu (version 0.12.0)
* ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon (version 5.11.1)
* PubSubClient by Nick O'Leary (version 2.7.0)
* Adafruit HTU21DF Library by Adafruit (version 1.0.1)
* Adafruit APDS9960 Library by Adafruit (version 1.0.5)
* DHT sensor library by Adafruit (version 1.3.4)
* U8g2 by oliver (version 2.23.18)
* OneWire (version 2.3.4)
* DallasTemperature (version 3.8.0)
* Adafruit Unified Sensor by Adafruit (version 1.0.2)
* Adafruit BMP085 Unified (version 1.0.0)

*Note: Issues might be experienced if using different versions of the libraries.*

## Flashing Custom Firmware

Follow the steps below to compile and flash custom firmware on ANAVI Thermometer from Arduino IDE:

1. To flash the firmware from Arduino IDE select Tools > Generic ESP8266 Module (Flash mode: DIO, Flash frequency: 40MHz, CPU frequency: 80MHz, Flash size: 4M, Debug port: Disabled, Debug level: None, Reset method: ck, Upload speed: 115200, Port: /dev/ttyUSB0). Set the flash size to 4M (1M SPIFFS). You might need to adjust the port if your USB to serial debug cable is connected on a different port.

2. After that press load an Arduino sketch. [A simple blinking LED example is available at GitHub](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-examples/blob/master/anavi-light-controller/anavi-blinking-led/anavi-blinking-led.ino)

3. In Arudino IDE click Verify/Compile (Ctrl+R)

4. Connect ANAVI Thermometer to the USB to serial debug board: GND to GND, TX cable to RX of ANAVI Thermometer and RX cable to TX of ANAVI Thermometer.

5. In Arudino IDE click Upload (Ctrl+U)

6. Press and **hold** the RESET button on ANAVI Thermometer. Plug the 5V power supply in the jack of ANAVI Thermometer (without releasing the RESET button).

7. In Arduino IDE verify that the upload has been started. Hold RESET until the upload completes.

The output in Arduino IDE for successful flashing is:

Please have a look at [the YouTube video that shows the exact steps for compiling and uploading an Arduino sketch to ANAVI Thermometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMIkPuz0ZJs).

**Note:** you have to be quick between step 5 and 6. Remember to press and **hold** SW1 until the upload completes.

# CHAPTER 4: Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) is a free and open-source home automation platform running on Python 3 with more than 1200 components for integration with popular Internet of Things.

ANAVI Thermometer can be easily integrated in Home Assistant using the component [MQTT sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt/). This component supports JSON in the payload of the MQTT messages. To use, in **configuration.yaml** specify MQTT broker and register the sensor with the correspoding MQTT topic, for example:

* Configure MQTT broker:

```
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
```

* Register the MQTT sensor:

```
sensor:
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Temperature"
      unit_of_measurement: 'C'
      state_topic: "home/room/temperature"
      value_template: "{{value_json.temperature}}"
    - platform: mqtt
      name: "Humidity"
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      state_topic: "home/room/humidity"
      value_template: "{{value_json.humidity}}"
```

# CHAPTER 5: Schematics

## Pinout

The components of ANAVI Thermometer relies on ESP8266 (ESP-12 module) and utilizes the following pins:

| Component           | Pins                            |  Arduino Pin ID |
| ------------------- |:------------------------------- |-----------------|
| I2C                 | 13, 14                          |                 |  
| DHT22/AM2302        | 11                              | 2               |
| DS18B20             | 6                               | 12              |
| Indication LED (D1) | 7                               | 16              |
| Reset button (SW1)  | 12                              | 0               |
| UART                | 15, 16                          |                 |

## I2C

The sensors that can be connected to ANAVI Thermometer communicate with a host microcontroller via a communications standard called **I2C** (Inter-Integrated-Circut). I2C uses two wires, labelled SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). To function properly, I2C requires a pullup resistor on each of those lines therefore ANAVI Thermometer includes two 4.7kohm resistors labelled as R2 and R3. If for one reason or another you need to disable the I2C pullup resistors remove R2 and R3.
